About
=====
mpsd is a daemon for keeping detailed stats of music played in mpd.

Requirements
============
* python 3
* sqlite3
* python3-mpd
* (Optional) sqltd (for html page generation)

Installation
============
* ./install - this will install to /usr/local/bin, and an init script to /etc/rc.d. Modify this to suit your system's needs.

        LOG_PATH: Path to the log file, default is /var/log/mpd/mpsd.log
        POLL_FREQUENCY: How often to poll mpd (in seconds).
        ADD_THRESHOLD: How far into the song to add the track, as a fraction of the track length (ie. this is a number between 0 and 1).

Make sure to re-install after reconfiguration.
